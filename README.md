# Get USD Coin Balance with Infura.io & Web3.js 1.0

Work in progress to sending USD Coin donation via Infura using Ethereum JSON RPC

For the moment, if you have more than 5 USDC you can try sending tokens to me as a donation.

If you don't have USD Coin you can buy it via 0x and I will get 2.75% of the value purchased.

If you don't have enough gas to make transaction, you can buy some ETH via changelly with your credit card

Feel free to fork this project or to improve the source code
